====	Creating an MVC Project (the hard way)
=============================================================

Create new project:
	Framework 4.6
	ASP.NET Web Application
	Empty 4.6 Template
	Uncheck "Host in the cloud"

Add Microsoft.AspNet.Mvc 5 via NuGet

Create a global event handler (Global.asax)

Tell the routing system to NOT pass resource requests (*.axd) to controllers
Instead, the routing system will stop and let IIS handle these as normal.

Create a controller. The containing folder name doesn't matter, but the class
should derive from Controller and the class name must end in "Controller".
We use attribute-based routing.

Configure attribute-based routing in the application start event.

Create a views folder (following the conventions), and add a Web.config file
to configure razor and prevent *.cshtml and other files from being served or
executed when accessed direction. In other words, stuff in the views folder
should only be accessible via routes and the view engine, not http://localhost/Views.

Add a view.

Add a model, pass it to the view in the controller. Mark the view as strongly-typed.

Use a layout.

Move the layout code to a _ViewStart file (note case of the word viewstart doesn't matter).
